#The above short cut will give a new r code

# There is a R markdown cheat sheet on Posit

# Running code will output the code in the Console and the Document

# When complete, you can click "Knit"

# Set-up your script ------------------------------------------------------

# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder", "pacman")) # uncomment if already installed
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, gapminder)

    Then load the data you want to work with into R.

# Load your Data into R ---------------------------------------------------

data(gapminder)
head(gapminder)

    Finally, start cleaning your data.

# Clean your Data ---------------------------------------------------------

gapminder_clean <- gapminder %>% 
  rename(life_exp = lifeExp, gdp_per_cap = gdpPercap) %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdp_per_cap)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
